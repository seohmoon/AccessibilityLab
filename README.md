# Accessibility Lab

Introducing my challenge, 'Accessibility Lab' that's all about accessibility!

Accessibility is about creating technology that's usable and welcoming for everyone, no matter their physical or cognitive abilities. With this app, you'll learn all about the different types of accessibility and how they can be applied to mobile devices.

One of the key features of the app is its interactive learning module, which teaches users about important accessibility features like voiceover, color contrast, text size, effects, buttons, and input options. Users can then test their knowledge by taking a quiz and reviewing the answers.

But that's not all â€“ the app also includes a unique experimental feature that allows users to customize the app's colors impact accessibility. By testing different combinations of background and button colors, users can better understand how accessibility features work in practice.

Accessibility is a critical issue in today's digital landscape, and my challenge is designed to empower users with knowledge and skills to create more inclusive technology. Whether you're a developer, designer, or simply someone who wants to learn more about accessibility, my challenge is the perfect tool to help you get started. Practice it today and discover a whole new world of Accessibility !
